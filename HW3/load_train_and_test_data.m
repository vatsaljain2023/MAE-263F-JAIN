function [X_train, Y_train, X_test, Y_test] = load_train_and_test_data()
% Reads training and testing data. The images are flattened out and normalized, labels are converted to one-hot encoded vector.
%     Inputs:
%         (None)
%     Outputs:
%     X_train: a  784 x N matrix representing the training images, where each column corresponds to a single image. N is the number of examples(images), which is 60000. The pixel intensities are normalized, holding values from 0 to 1.
%     Y_train: a K x N matrix representing the labels of the training images, where each column corresponds to a one-hot encoding of a single image. K is the number of classes, which is 10. N is the number of examples, 60000.
%      X_test: a 784 x N_t matrix representing the testing images, where each column corresponds to a single image. The pixel intensities are normalized, holding values from 0 to 1. N_t is the number of test examples, which is 100000.
%      Y_test: a K x N_t matrix representing the labels of the testing images, where each column corresponds to a one-hot encoding of a single image.
